## Problem
The Asian Games is about to take place in Indonesia. this is a prestigious sporting event with a gathering of athletes from all parts of continental Asia and held every 4 years.

While the event will begin in a matter of days, many people still do not know in detail about everything that happened at the event. Although special web pages are already available on the internet, but the quality of competence on the web is still not enough to meet the desire of netizens to find information fast and accurate.

## Proposed Solution 
A mobile app that allows users to know all the details about the Asian Games. The information provided includes details of the competition, details of the venue, details of the participants, and users can also watch live matches as well as social chat features.

This app is pretty good it just takes some more development in terms of multimedia and design, according to the author, is too complicated.

And also in fact there are already 2018 Asian Games applications in the playstore but this application is made not by the committee, which is independently built.

according to the authors, the UI built in the application is very minimalist, so it will not attract the attention of users to wear them.
